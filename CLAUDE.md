- `docs/deployed.md` — deployment truth
- `docs/architecture.md` — system graph
- `docs/conventions.md` — pattern library
- `docs/sessions/` — monthly session logs (grep by date)
- `docs/bugs/` — per-file bug KB (grep by service or tag)
- `docs/specs-plans.md` — pointer into `docs/specs/` and `docs/plans/`
